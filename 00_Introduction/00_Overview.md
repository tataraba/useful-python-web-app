# Hello, World. Nice to Meet You! Uh, Now What?

Python is known to be a beginner-friendly language. Even something relatively complex, such as a web app, can be built and run with just a few lines of code. But the complexity for beginners ramps up very quickly. 

I decided to create this repository for my past self. That _past self_ was stumbling into intermediate concepts in Python, and was contemplating how difficult it might be to build a web application. I was stumbling across many tutorials that got me to the door, but never quite pushed beyond to the next step.

>I do want to emphasize that there are some excellent resources, both free and paid, that I originally missed as I was getting started. My hope is that I provide less resistance for those who are really ready to move forward.

## What This Is

The primary objective of this repository is to show how to build a Python web application using FastAPI and MongoDB into something that can ultimately be deployed and used _in real life_.

This is a centralized container of text, resources, and examples of things I learned along the way while trying to launch my own blog, [Python By Night](https://www.pythonbynight.com).

It will cover some of the concepts that I struggled with as I began my journey and detail some of the lessons I learned along the way. I also plan to add/subtract content to ensure it remains a valuable resource for anyone that happens to stumble upon it.

If you're a beginner in Python, it might feel like you're being thrown in the _deep end_, but hopefully with a life preserver nearby.

## What This Isn't

Please do not think of these topics as anything resembling "best practices" or "production tested" design patterns. These observations are from the perspective of someone who wrote their first line of Python code at the end of 2018 (without prior development experience) and plugged away at learning the language in snippets during my spare time.

It is likely that there are some errors or oddities in the code, but keep in mind that this all comes from a genuine desire to learn and grow, and provides you an opportunity to go beyond the general guardrails provided here.

I genuinely hope that you find ways to solve problems even outside of what I suggest here. And if you do, I'd love to hear about it and learn from you as well!
