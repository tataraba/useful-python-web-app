## Create Your Own App Structure

To get going, you may want to make sure you've gotten all setup and ready to go.

#### Requirements
-   Make sure you have Python installed in your system
-   Be comfortable in your IDE/Text editor of choice
-   Understand how to create a virtual environment and how to activate it

### Step 1

Choose a folder on your system for your project root. Create a directory that mimics the following layout. (You don't have to create the `venv` folder. That can be created when you make your virtual environment.):

    project_root/                   # can be any name you choose
    ┣ src/                          # typically called "app" or "src"
    ┃ ┣ api/
    ┃ ┣ core/
    ┃ ┣ crud/
    ┃ ┣ db/
    ┃ ┣ lib/
    ┃ ┣ models/
    ┃ ┣ main.py                     # follow instructions below
    ┃ ┗ __init__.py                 # keep empty
    ┣ tests/
    ┣ venv/                         # virtual environment
    ┣ .env                          # create .env file
    ┣ .gitignore                    # create .gitignore file

### Step 2

Open up the project in your favorite IDE/Text editor and create a virtual environment (preferably using Python 3.9 or newer).

Make sure you are in your `project_root`. In most cases, the command you are looking for is:

    python -m venv venv

>So one of the requirements listed above is to be "comfortable" in your IDE. I'm not going to devote time to this (currently), but your primary goal will be to open up your project within your IDE at the "project_root" level. But when doing this, you _may_ need to tell/configure your IDE to look for modules in your "app" or "src" directory as well.

### Step 3

The `main.py` file will be responsible for starting your FastAPI application. But first, make sure you have FastAPI installed.

Assuming you have already **created** and **activated** your virtual environment. Let's pip install some stuff!

    python -m pip install fastapi

And also uvicorn:

    python -m pip install "uvicorn[standard]"

>Note: I'll be using `python -m pip` for any package installations. If you're wondering why, you can read [this article by Brett Cannon](https://snarky.ca/why-you-should-use-python-m-pip/).

Then, in your `main.py` file, create an instance of a FastAPI application. You can do that like this:

    from fastapi import FastAPI

    def get_app() -> FastAPI:

        app = FastAPI()

        return app


    app = get_app()

We will obviously add to this later, but for now, it should suffice.

## Next Steps

The objective should be to have a relative idea of what your application will be doing by building a skeleton/framework that is in line with your overall goals. Feel free to modify your app structure into something that makes sense for you. Take your time.
