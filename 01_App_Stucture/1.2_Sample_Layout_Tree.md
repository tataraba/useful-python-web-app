# Sample App Layout

Here is a pared down example of what I use for [Python By Night](https://www.pythonbynight.com). It provides a way to include most of the functionality you would need for a basic web application, with room to grow or expand, based on a variety of use cases. 

This example implies that the content is for a blog-like application that contains users and articles, but can be modified for other use cases. 

    app_root/                   # project root - holds all project data
    ┣ app/                      # "app" is a Python package (where the application "lives")
    ┃ ┣ api/
    ┃ ┃ ┣ routes/               # holds application endpoints
    ┃ ┣ core/
    ┃ ┃ ┣ config.py             # default app settings/configuration
    ┃ ┃ ┣ log.py                # application logging setup
    ┃ ┃ ┗ __init__.py
    ┃ ┣ crud/
    ┃ ┃ ┣ article.py            # application logic and functions relevant to articles
    ┃ ┃ ┣ user.py               # application logic and functions relevant to users
    ┃ ┃ ┗ __init__.py
    ┃ ┣ db/
    ┃ ┃ ┣ db.py                 # database setup and initialization
    ┃ ┃ ┗ __init__.py
    ┃ ┣ lib/
    ┃ ┃ ┣ util.py               # helper functions used throughout the application
    ┃ ┃ ┗ __init__.py
    ┃ ┣ models/
    ┃ ┃ ┣ mixins/               # can be used for mixin classes for database models
    ┃ ┃ ┣ article.py            # database models for articles
    ┃ ┃ ┣ base.py               # base model class -inherited by all db models
    ┃ ┃ ┣ user.py               # database models for users
    ┃ ┃ ┗ __init__.py
    ┃ ┣ main.py                 # where the FastAPI application is created
    ┃ ┗ __init__.py             # this is what makes "app" a Python package
    ┣ tests/                    # tests go in here (outside of the "app" package)
    ┣ venv/                     # virtual environment
    ┣ .env                      # secrets that don't belong hard coded in the config file
    ┣ .gitignore                # include .env here to protect secrets!
    ┗ requirements.txt          # keep track of dependencies/libraries used in project


The following is an even more pared down version of this, but it gets pretty close.

I include it here to help you get a sense of how you could build your own application. What would you do the same? What would you do differently?
