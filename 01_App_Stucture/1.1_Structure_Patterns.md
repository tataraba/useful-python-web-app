# App Structure Patterns

There are many different ways to approach your web application structure. If you are unsure about the benefits of (or even the differences between) something like Singleton, MVC (model, view, controller) or DDD (domain driven design) patterns, I wouldn't spend too much time fretting over it.

A better approach early on is to ensure that you at least _think_ about what your application will be doing ahead of time and then try to build a structure that makes sense in that context.

You may want to take a look at how other apps are built, or maybe familiarize yourself with what those terms in the intro paragraph truly mean. But at the end of the day, you need to get started somewhere.

## FastAPI Design

These examples will be based on what has worked for me for my blog, but I want to share two links that may prove helpful.

-   [FastAPI - Bigger Applications](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/)
-   [Bob Waycott - Flask App Organization](https://bobwaycott.com/blog/how-i-use-flask/flask-app-organization/)

You'll notice that the second link uses Flask as the example framework, but the concepts in that article were very helpful to me when I got started.
