# Build a Useful Python Web Application

Hi. I started learning Python at the end of 2018 with hardly any programming background and just enough curiosity to get my feet wet. A few years later, after a couple of on-again, off-again stints, I decided to build a blog called [Python By Night](https://www.pythonbynight.com) to write about the what I learned along the way.

Keep in mind that this happened outside of "work hours", as my day job, family, and hobbies take up the majority of my time. But if you're here, chances are you're on a similar path, and I want to encourage you to keep going.

In addition to my blog, I wanted a way to share some of the things I've learned over the last year or so, starting with the importance of being able to build something that is actually _useful_.

I don't want to disparage all the awesome "Hello, World!" tutorials out there, but aside from a few exceptions, I found it hard to find free, in-depth guides to really push my learning&mdash;with the ultimate benefit of creating a robust application I could use in real time.
## Who Is This For?

Well, this mostly started out as something for myself. I know, right? Why go through all this trouble for an audience of one?

In actuality, I hope this is more mutually beneficial. As for myself, it has forced me to focus and solidify a lot of the concepts I may have glossed over as I was building *Python By Night*.

This is also for you if you want to move beyond the sense of being a "beginner" with Python.

Have you often found yourself in a redundant pattern of finishing tutorial after tutorial without finding your footing as to where to go next? Have you built Python scripts that do cool things, but aren't quite sure what to do with them next?

This might be a good place to put your ideas into action by building and deploying a functional web application.

## Objective

By following the guided sections, you should be able to build a web application that can be deployed into production. It should provide you with a solid foundation and get you on your way to work on the really fun and interesting parts of your Python code&mdash;what your app is actually _meant_ to do.
