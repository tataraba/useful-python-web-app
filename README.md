# Build a Useful Python Web Application

Hi. I started learning Python at the end of 2018 with curiosity, and a few years later, I built a blog called [Python By Night](https://www.pythonbynight.com) to talk about the things I've learned.

In addition to my blog, I wanted a way to share some of the things I've learned over the last year or so, starting with the importance of being able to build something that is actually _useful_.

Not to knock on all those wonderful "Hello, World!" tutorials out there, but aside from a few exceptions, it was hard finding in-depth guides to really push my learning&mdash;with the benefit of creating something I could actually use as a result.

## Who Is This For?

Well, this mostly started out as something for myself. I know, right. Why go through all this trouble for an audience of one?

In actuality, I hope this is more mutually beneficial. As for myself, it has forced me to focus and solidify a lot of the concepts I may have glossed over as I was building Python By Night.

This is also for you if you want to move beyond the sense of being a "beginner" at Python. This may also be for you if you have often found yourself in a redundant pattern of finishing tutorial after tutorial with nothing to show for it. It may also be for you if you have been using Python scripts to do cool things, and you want to maybe put those ideas into a functioning web application.

## Objective

By following the guided sections, you should be able to end up with a web application that can be taken into production. It should provide you with a pretty good foundation and get you on your way to work on the really fun parts of your application&mdash;what your app is actually _meant_ to do.
