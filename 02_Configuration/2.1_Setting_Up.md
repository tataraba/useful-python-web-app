# Setting Up

The way I feel about _configuration_ is about the same way I feel about _exercise_. I know it's good for me, and it will ensure success in whatever discipline I focus on, but it sure is hard to do sometimes. 

When you're looking to build a web application of any sort, you better believe that having a good configuration setup will benefit you in the long run. I actually believe that it will make your application better, because you will spend less time fretting about whenever you need to turn some knobs and pull some levers.

With FastAPI, you can set up your configuration in a myriad of ways. I tried a few before settling with something that worked well for me. It is very heavily based on [Redowan Delowar](https://twitter.com/rednafi)'s article [Pedantic Configuration Management with Pydantic](https://rednafi.github.io/digressions/python/2020/06/03/python-configs.html).

He lists out a few goals with his approach, and one that really stuck out to me was this:

>Switch between the different environments e.g development, staging effortlessly.

## Switch It Up

I knew going in that I would want to ultimately end up with a development environment that would allow me to try new things, add new features, test new packages, etc... But if I wanted to deploy a production site, I would want to ensure that the settings would be unique to my production environment. 

I already had a fuzzy idea of a database devoted to sandboxing or refining ideas, and another to hold my "real" data. I already knew that I would, at the very least, have two separate sets of database credentials.

But was there an easy way to switch contexts without having to hard code my settings each time?

## Why Is This Important?

When you're developing, there's a quick and dirty way to change settings&mdash;namely, doing it inline. It might feel like it's saving you time when you start out, but it will ultimately slow you down and open you up to possible mishaps (like keeping a super secret password nestled in your code by accident).

Don't postpone setting up your application with a capable and thorough configuration system. It's like trying to hold your pee. Do you really want to play a game of Russian Roulette with your pants? 

## FastAPI and Pydantic

The fact that FastAPI builds on top of [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io) means that you can utilize it for awesome settings management. The FastAPI docs include a [very thorough (and enlightening) explanation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/settings/) of how you can do that.

If you're so inclined, check out both of the resources I've provide in this section.

- [FastAPI - Settings and Environment Variables](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/settings/)

You may not even need to come back here. But if you're on a roll and for some reason like taking advice from someone who only has time to work on Python when he's half-asleep, then do carry on!
