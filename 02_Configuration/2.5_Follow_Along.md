## Build Your Configuration Backbone

This will define how your application finds and uses the ever so necessary configuration data, including those super secret settings that you may be hiding in your sock drawer.

#### Requirements
- Have a grasp of what environment variables are and why you would use them
- Prepare a list of your _super secret_ variables
- Be willing to revisit your configuration, adjusting until it makes sense to you

### Step 1

Populate your `.env` file. The only "required" key/value pair is:

    ENV_STATE = "dev"   # or prd

I would recommend when working with a database, have a separate URI specifically for development. This could be a local instance, or contained within the same cloud provider.

In any case, I would still separate your development database from your production database. We will get into this a little more when we talk about database models. 

But for now, that means that your `.env` file might also include:

    DEV_SECRET_KEY = "FreshOutOfBatteries"
    PRD_SECRET_KEY = "ButStillMakingNoise"

    DEV_MONGO_SCHEME = mongodb+srv
    DEV_MONGO_HOST = fakecluster.example.mongodb.net
    DEV_MONGO_USER = dev_app_user
    DEV_MONGO_PASS = ShhDontTell
    DEV_MONGO_DB = dev_app_database

    PRD_MONGO_SCHEME = mongodb+srv
    PRD_MONGO_HOST = fakecluster.example.mongodb.net 
    PRD_MONGO_USER = prd_app_user
    PRD_MONGO_PASS = ISaidDontTell
    PRD_MONGO_DB = prd_app_database

If you haven't setup your database just yet, that's fine. Keep these generic values in until we move on the next section where I talk about MongoDB a little more.

>Note, there is some repetition here. The scheme and host are the same. Whatever happened to DRY principles (don't repeat yourself)?

I believe this is a valid exception. You may start out with one cluster housing both, your production and development databases. But what if you wanted to migrate one of those, but keep the other intact? 

### Step 2

Create a `config.py` file inside of your `core` directory.

    src/
    ┣ api/
    ┣ core/
    ┃ ┗ config.py   #  yup, right here
    ┣ crud/
    ┣ db/
    ┣ lib/
    ┣ models/
    ┣ main.py
    ┗ __init__.py


### Step 3

Let's import a few tools we're going to use in our configuration file.

    from functools import lru_cache
    from pathlib import Path
    
    from pydantic import BaseModel, BaseSettings, Field

The one here that you may be most unfamiliar with is `lru_cache`. To be honest, I can't explain this one in too much detail. All you need to know is that this will eventually help us read settings from disk only once (typically a slow operation). Then we can re-use the same settings object each time, instead of reading it every time it is requested.

### Step 4

The meat and bones of this operation follows in the next few steps, but they are all fairly straightforward. 

Firstly, I like to make a variable that accesses our application root directory.

    APP_DIR = Path(__file__).parent.parent

You can use the [Pathlib builtin module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to find yoru root directory. If you're unsure how that's working, read the docs.

### Step 5

Our next object is to define the application settings for FastAPI. These are typically values that are passed to the FastAPI constructor, defining certain application behavior.

Here, we use a pydantic `BaseModel`. It will be inherited into our eventual configuration class.

    class AppConfig(BaseModel):
        """Application configuration using pydantic `BaseModel`. 
        Will be accessed as `more_settings` within the application.
        """

        title: str = "For Real App"
        version: str = "0.1.0"
        docs_url: str = "/docs"
        redoc_url: str = "/redoc"
        openapi_url: str = "/openapi.json"

FastAPI uses those last three values for the awesome, auto-generated OpenAPI docs, which are extremely valuable if you're building an API driven application.

Those paths define where you can find those documents, should you choose to chang/modify the eventual url to those documents.

We will bring in these settings into our GlobalConfig class so we can access them directly with the `more_settings` attribute. You'll see that next, but here's what it will look like:

    more_settings: AppConfig = AppConfig()

### Step 6

Here's what the full file looks like from top to bottom, with an added `@property` that comes in handy a little later. You could leave it in or take it out, depending on your use case. It makes disabling FastAPI docs in production a little easier.

Other than that, here's the code:

    from typing import Optional, Dict, Any
    from functools import lru_cache
    from pathlib import Path

    from pydantic import BaseModel, BaseSettings, Field


    APP_DIR = Path(__file__).parent.parent


    class AppConfig(BaseModel):
        """Application configuration using pydantic `BaseModel`. 
        Will be accessed as `more_settings` within the application.
        """

        title: str = "For Real App"
        version: str = "0.1.0"
        docs_url: str = "/docs"
        redoc_url: str = "/redoc"
        openapi_url: str = "/openapi.json"


    class GlobalConfig(BaseSettings):
        """Global configuration using pydantic `BaseSettings`.
        Will be accessed as `settings` within the application.
        """

        more_settings: AppConfig = AppConfig()

        SECRET_KEY: str = "secret_defined_in_env"

        MONGO_SCHEME: Optional[str] = None
        MONGO_HOST: Optional[str] = None
        MONGO_PORT: Optional[str] = None
        MONGO_USER: Optional[str] = None
        MONGO_PASS: Optional[str] = None
        MONGO_DB: Optional[str] = None

        @property   # Optional - makes loading values to FastAPI easier
        def fastapi_kwargs(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
            fastapi_kwargs = self.more_settings.dict()
            if self.DISABLE_DOCS:     # Disable FastAPI docs - for production
                fastapi_kwargs.update(
                    {
                        "docs_url": None,
                        "redoc_url": None,
                        "openapi_url": None,
                        "openapi_prefix": None,
                    }
                )
            return fastapi_kwargs

        class Config:
            env_file = APP_DIR / ".env"
            env_file_encoding = "utf-8"

    class DevConfig(GlobalConfig):
        """Configuration for development environment.
        """

        class Config:
            env_prefix = "DEV_"


    class PrdConfig(GlobalConfig):
        """Configuration for production environment.
        """

        class Config:
            env_prefix = "PRD_"



    class FactoryConfig:
        def __init__(self, env_state: Optional[str]):
            self.env_state = env_state

        def __call__(self) -> Any:
            if self.env_state == "dev":

                return DevConfig()

            elif self.env_state == "prd":
                return PrdConfig()


    settings = FactoryConfig(GlobalConfig().ENV_STATE)()


    @lru_cache()
    def get_app_settings() -> DevConfig | PrdConfig:
        """Returns a cached instance of the settings (config) object.
        To change env variable and reset cache during 
        testing, use the 'lru_cache' instance method 
        'get_app_settings.cache_clear()'.
        """

        return settings


### Step 7 (Optional - Good to Know Stuff)

You can call the `settings` directly, or, if you want to benefit from the caching mechanism, use `get_app_settings()` instead.

In your modules, instead of using:

    from app.core.config import settings

You might instead do something like:

    from app.core.config import get_app_settings

    settings = get_app_settings()

If you're changing the env variable from "dev" to "prd" during testing, or updating your .env values, you want to make sure you clear your cache before loading settings again.

That might look like this:

    from app.core.config import get_app_settings

    get_app_settings.clear_cache()
    settings = get_app_settings()
