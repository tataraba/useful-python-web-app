## Build Your Configuration Backbone

This will define how your application finds and uses the ever so necessary configuration data, including those super secret settings that you may be hiding in your sock drawer.

#### Requirements
- Have a grasp of what environment variables are and why you would use them
- Prepare a list of your _super secret_ variables
- Be willing to revisit your configuration, adjusting until it makes sense to you

### Step 1

Populate your `.env` file. The only "required" key/value pair is:

    ENV_STATE = "dev"   # or prd

I would recommend when working with a database, have a separate URI specifically for development. This could be a local instance, or contained within the same cloud provider.

In which case, you'll have two sets of data for your development and production databases. We will get into this a little more when we talk about database models. 

But for now, that means that your `.env` file might also include:

    ENV_STATE = dev

    DEV_SECRET_KEY = OutOfBatteries
    PRD_SECRET_KEY = StillMakingNoise

    DEV_MONGO_SCHEME = mongodb
    DEV_MONGO_HOST = localhost
    DEV_MONGO_PORT = 127.0.0.1
    DEV_MONGO_USER = dev_app_user
    DEV_MONGO_PASS = ShhDontTell
    DEV_MONGO_DB = dev_app_database

    PRD_MONGO_SCHEME = mongodb+srv
    PRD_MONGO_HOST = fakecluster.example.mongodb.net
    PRD_MONGO_PORT = ""
    PRD_MONGO_USER = prd_app_user
    PRD_MONGO_PASS = ISaidDontTell
    PRD_MONGO_DB = prd_app_database

If you haven't setup your database just yet, that's fine. Keep these generic values in until we move on to the next section where I talk about MongoDB in more detail.

### Step 2

Create a `config.py` file inside of your `core` directory.

    src/
    ┣ api/
    ┣ core/
    ┃ ┗ config.py   #  yup, right here
    ┣ crud/
    ┣ db/
    ┣ lib/
    ┣ models/
    ┣ main.py
    ┗ __init__.py


### Step 3

Let's import a few tools we're going to use in our configuration file.

    from functools import lru_cache
    from pathlib import Path
    
    from pydantic import BaseModel, BaseSettings, Field

The one here that you may be most unfamiliar with is `lru_cache`. To be honest, I can't explain this one in too much detail. All you need to know is that this will eventually help us read settings from disk only once (typically a slow operation). Then we can re-use the same settings object each time, instead of reading it every time it is requested.

### Step 4

The meat and bones of this operation follows in the next few steps, but hopefully not overly complicated. 

Firstly, I like to make a variable that accesses our application root directory (in this case, it is the `src` folder).

    APP_DIRECTORY = Path(__file__).parent.parent

You can use the [Pathlib builtin module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to find your root directory. If you're unsure how that's working, you can read more on the documentation or search for tutorials on the Pathlib library.

### Step 5

Our next object is to define the application settings for FastAPI. These are typically values that are passed to the FastAPI constructor, defining certain application behavior.

Here, we use a pydantic `BaseModel`. It will be inherited into our eventual configuration class.

    class AppConfig(BaseModel):
        """Application configuration using pydantic `BaseModel`. 
        Will be accessed as `more_settings` within the application.
        """

        title: str = "For Real App"
        version: str = "0.1.0"
        docs_url: str = "/docs"
        redoc_url: str = "/redoc"
        openapi_url: str = "/openapi.json"

FastAPI uses those last three values for the awesome, auto-generated OpenAPI docs, which are extremely valuable if you're building an API driven application.

Those paths define where you can find those documents, should you choose to change/modify the eventual url to those documents.

We will bring in these settings into our GlobalConfig class so we can access them directly with the `more_settings` attribute. You'll see that next, but here's what it will look like:

    more_settings: AppConfig = AppConfig()

### Step 6

Here's what the full file looks like from top to bottom, with an added `@property` that comes in handy a little later. You could leave it in or take it out, depending on your use case. It makes disabling FastAPI docs in production a little easier.

Other than that, here's the code:

    from typing import Optional, Dict, Any, Union
    from functools import lru_cache
    from pathlib import Path

    from pydantic import BaseModel, BaseSettings, Field


    APP_DIRECTORY = Path(__file__).parent.parent  # two levels up from current directory is src folder

    class AppConfig(BaseModel):
        """Application configuration using pydantic `BaseModel`. 
        Will be accessed as `more_settings` within the application.
        """

        title: str = "Pinkerton"
        version: str = "0.1.0"
        docs_url: str = "/docs"
        redoc_url: str = "/redoc"
        openapi_url: str = "/openapi.json"


    class GlobalConfig(BaseSettings):
        """Global configuration using pydantic `BaseSettings`.
        Will be accessed as `settings` within the application.
        """

        more_settings: AppConfig = AppConfig()
        APP_DIR: Path = APP_DIRECTORY
        
        ENV_STATE: Optional[str] = Field(None, env="ENV_STATE")
        DISABLE_DOCS: bool = False

        SECRET_KEY: str = "overriden_by_dotenv_value"

        MONGO_SCHEME: Optional[str] = None
        MONGO_HOST: Optional[str] = None
        MONGO_PORT: Optional[str] = None
        MONGO_USER: Optional[str] = None
        MONGO_PASS: Optional[str] = None
        MONGO_DB: Optional[str] = None

        @property   # Optional - makes loading values to FastAPI easier
        def fastapi_kwargs(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
            fastapi_kwargs = self.more_settings.dict()
            if self.DISABLE_DOCS:     # Disable FastAPI docs when in prd
                fastapi_kwargs.update(
                    {
                        "docs_url": None,
                        "redoc_url": None,
                        "openapi_url": None,
                        "openapi_prefix": None,
                    }
                )
            return fastapi_kwargs

        class Config:
            env_file = APP_DIRECTORY.parent / ".env"
            env_file_encoding = "utf-8"

    class DevConfig(GlobalConfig):
        """Configuration for development environment.
        """

        class Config:
            env_prefix = "DEV_"


    class PrdConfig(GlobalConfig):
        """Configuration for production environment.
        """

        class Config:
            env_prefix = "PRD_"



    class FactoryConfig:
        """Callable class. Will load `DevConfig` or `PrdConfig`
        depending on the `ENV_STATE` set in the `GlobalConfig`
        class.
        """

        def __init__(self, env_state: Optional[str]):
            self.env_state = env_state

        def __call__(self) -> Any:
            if self.env_state == "dev":

                return DevConfig()

            elif self.env_state == "prd":
                return PrdConfig()


    settings = FactoryConfig(GlobalConfig().ENV_STATE)()


    @lru_cache()
    def get_app_settings() -> Union[DevConfig, PrdConfig]:
        """Returns a cached instance of the settings (config) object.
        To change env variable and reset cache during 
        testing, use the 'lru_cache' instance method 
        'get_app_settings.cache_clear()'.
        """
        return settings

### Step 7 (Optional - Not Really a Step but Good to Know Stuff)

You can call the `settings` directly, or, if you want to benefit from the caching mechanism, use `get_app_settings()` instead.

In your modules, instead of using:

    from app.core.config import settings

You might instead do something like:

    from app.core.config import get_app_settings

    settings = get_app_settings()

If you're changing the env variable from "dev" to "prd" during testing, or updating your `.env` values, you want to make sure you clear your cache before loading settings again.

That might look like this:

    from app.core.config import get_app_settings

    get_app_settings.clear_cache()
    settings = get_app_settings()
