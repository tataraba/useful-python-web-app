# Validating the URI

One of the features of pydantic is that it can help validate values coming in and save you a bunch of headaches down the road.

I use this feature to validate my MongoDB connection string at the same time that it's built.

## Database Configuration

You could potentially include this configuration in your `config.py` file, but I like to create a separate place where I handle my database connection.

However, the process involves using a pydantic validator to make sure my URI string is valid.

Notice what's happening here:

    from pydantic import AnyUrl, BaseSettings, validator
    from src.core.config import settings
    
    class DataBase(BaseSettings):
        """Utility class to define mongodb settings."""

        MONGO_DB_URI: Optional[AnyUrl] = None  # insert URI directly 

        @validator("MONGO_DB_URI", pre=True)
        def db_is_valid(cls, v):
            if isinstance(v, str):
                return v
            return AnyUrl.build(
                scheme=settings.MONGO_SCHEME,
                user=settings.MONGO_USER,
                password=settings.MONGO_PASS,
                host=settings.MONGO_HOST,
            )


So what's happening here?

We have the ability to insert a URI directly using `MONGO_DB_URI`. Normally, you may not want to do this, but it provides a quick and dirty solution if you are doing a quick test.

For me, it was very useful because in addition to Atlas, I had a local version of MongoDB (Community Edition) running locally. I would often insert the URI for that local version when testing a quick feature.

The `@validator` decorator checks to make sure that the `MONGO_DB_URI` that is entered is valid. It does so by checking if the value is of type `AnyUrl`&mdash;a pydantic field type with specifc rules.

>You can learn more about pydantic field types in the [documentation](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/).

However, in the event that it is not valid (or when set to `None`), the decorator "builds" the `AnyUrl` using the parameters from our `config.py` file.

Note that we are importing `settings` from our `config.py` module. The corresponding values will be based on the `ENV_VAR` value defined in our `.env` file. 

If we have `ENV_VAR = "dev"` selected, that means that `settings.MONGO_USER` corresponds to `DEV_MONGO_USER`.

You get the idea.

Anyway, pydantic takes care of building our URI and validating the path structure!

## Which Database?

You'll notice that the URI string does not include the name of the database we will be using (either the "dev" or "prd" database).

We will let our ODM handle that part.
