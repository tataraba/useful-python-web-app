# Model Behavior

If you are building a dynamic application (and if you're reading this, the likelihood is that you are), then you will undoubtedly be using database resources.

Choosing the _right_ database solution for your app, as well as what design paradigm you will be following is well beyond the scope of what I'm doing here. 

But I would encourage you to spend a lot of time thinking and planning and iterating on this step. For _Python By Night_, I had a fairly advanced version of a PostgreSQL solution running. 

Yet, I decided to shift direction and landed on MongoDB, and am glad I did.

My examples will focus on a MongoDB solution, but you could likely have a similar solution with SQL, especially if you use something like [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com).

## Using MongoDB

If you want to use MongoDB, you can either [download the Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and run MongoDB locally (this is free), or you can sign up for a free [Atlas cloud account](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database), which gives you 512 MB of free cloud storage.

I used a local instance at first, but it might add to the complexity of what you are doing. An Atlas account should suffice, especially if you're keen to get up and running.

## Python and MongoDB

For your Python application to talk to the MongoDB database, we need a way to communicate between your code and the database. Think of it as a translator of sorts.

In the development space, you will typically use an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for relational databases, or an Object Document Mapper (ODM) for document-based databases, like MongoDB.

There are a few ORMs to choose from, one of the most popular is [SQLAlchemy](https://sqlalchemy.org) (SQLModel uses SQLAlchemy and pydantic&mdash;created by the author of FastAPI).

To use MongoDB in Python, you will likely come across [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is a Python wrapper for MongoDB.

There are a couple of newer ODMs that use _asynchronous_ functions to interact with MongoDB.

The one I use is called [Beanie](https://roman-right.github.io/beanie/), and it is the one I use in my following examples.
